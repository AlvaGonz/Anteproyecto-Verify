# OWASP Security Best Practices Skill

Apply these security standards when writing or reviewing code.

## Quick Reference: OWASP Top 10:2025

| # | Vulnerability | Key Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | Deny by default, enforce server-side, verify ownership |
| A02 | Security Misconfiguration | Harden configs, disable defaults, minimize features |
| A03 | Supply Chain Failures | Lock versions, verify integrity, audit dependencies |
| A04 | Cryptographic Failures | TLS 1.2+, AES-256-GCM, Argon2/bcrypt for passwords |
| A05 | Injection | Parameterized queries, input validation, safe APIs |
| A06 | Insecure Design | Threat model, rate limit, design security controls |
| A07 | Auth Failures | MFA, check breached passwords, secure sessions |
| A08 | Integrity Failures | Sign packages, SRI for CDN, safe serialization |
| A09 | Logging Failures | Log security events, structured format, alerting |
| A10 | Exception Handling | Fail-closed, hide internals, log with context |

## Security Code Review Checklist

### Input Handling
- All user input validated server-side
- Using parameterized queries (not string concatenation)
- Input length limits enforced
- Allowlist validation preferred over denylist

### Authentication & Sessions
- Passwords hashed with Argon2/bcrypt (not MD5/SHA1)
- Session tokens have sufficient entropy (128+ bits)
- Sessions invalidated on logout
- MFA available for sensitive operations

### Access Control
- Check for framework-level auth middleware before flagging missing per-route auth
- Authorization checked on every request
- Using object references user cannot manipulate
- Deny by default policy
- Privilege escalation paths reviewed

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- TLS for all data in transit
- No sensitive data in URLs/logs
- Secrets in environment/vault (not code)

### Error Handling
- No stack traces exposed to users
- Fail-closed on errors (deny, not allow)
- All exceptions logged with context
- Consistent error responses (no enumeration)

## Agentic AI Security (OWASP 2026)

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| ASI01 | Goal Hijack | Input sanitization, goal boundaries |
| ASI02 | Tool Misuse | Least privilege, validate I/O |
| ASI03 | Privilege Abuse | Short-lived scoped tokens |
| ASI04 | Supply Chain | Verify signatures, sandbox |
| ASI05 | Code Execution | Sandbox, static analysis |
| ASI06 | Memory Poisoning | Validate stored content |
| ASI07 | Agent Comms | Authenticate, encrypt |
| ASI08 | Cascading Failures | Circuit breakers, isolation |
| ASI09 | Trust Exploitation | Label AI content, verification |
| ASI10 | Rogue Agents | Behavior monitoring, kill switches |

## ASVS 5.0 Key Requirements
- **Level 1:** Passwords min 12 chars, breached list checks, rate limiting, 128+ bits entropy, HTTPS.
- **Level 2:** All L1 + MFA for sensitive ops, crypto key management, logging, input validation.
- **Level 3:** All L1/L2 + HSMs, threat modeling, advanced monitoring, pen testing.
